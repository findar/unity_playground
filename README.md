# unity_playground

My attempt at a boilerplate Unity project.  The goal will be to create a standard folder structure, player prefab, and area prefab for the player to interact with.  By default control will be limited to WASD however in future iterations I might leave in stub code for mouse and other ways to interact.  This is an evolving project.
